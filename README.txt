The objective with this repository is to provide an easy to use python 3 library that includes 
the most commonly used methods for color augmentation and normalisation of histopathology images, having as input local image regions stained with H&amp;E.

## Pre-requisites and Installation
The library was developed and tested in a python 3.8 conda environment.  The following packages are required:
- scikit-image
- scipy
- pillow
- opencv-python
- spams

You can find a complete list of the packages installed when developed the library under utils/enviroment.yml
 
For installing the library you can do it with pip:
pip install -e stainlib/ 
 
## Examples
You can find examples for using stainlib in the jupyter notebooks stainlib_augmentation.ipynb and stainlib_normalization.ipynb
